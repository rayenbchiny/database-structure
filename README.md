                                               Slide 1: Introduction

           Title: Comparing MongoDB and SQL
Brief introduction to NoSQL and SQL databases
Purpose of the presentation
Slide 2: MongoDB - NoSQL Database

Definition of MongoDB
Document-based architecture
Key functionalities:
Flexible schema
Scalability
High availability
Slide 3: SQL - Relational Database

Definition of SQL (Structured Query Language)
Relational database structure
Key functionalities:
ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
Well-defined schema
Support for complex queries and transactions
Slide 4: MongoDB Functionalities

MongoDB:
Document-based storage: JSON-like documents
Schema flexibility: No predefined structure
Horizontal scalability: Sharding
High availability: Replication and failover mechanisms
Slide 5: SQL Functionalities

SQL:
Table-based storage: Rows and columns
Structured schema: Predefined schema with relations
ACID properties: Ensures data integrity and consistency
Complex queries: Joins, aggregations, subqueries
Slide 6: Comparison

Data Model:
MongoDB: Document-based model, flexible schema
SQL: Table-based model, structured schema
Scalability:
MongoDB: Horizontal scalability via sharding
SQL: Vertical scalability through hardware upgrades
Query Language:
MongoDB: Query language similar to JavaScript
SQL: Standardized SQL language with various dialects
Transactions:
MongoDB: Limited support for transactions in recent versions
SQL: Strong support for transactions with ACID properties
Use Cases:
MongoDB: Real-time analytics, scalable applications, unstructured or semi-structured data
SQL: Transactions, complex queries, data integrity and consistency requirements
Slide 7: Conclusion

Recap of key differences between MongoDB and SQL
Considerations for choosing between NoSQL and SQL databases
